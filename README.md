== Candid Backbone Calendar

Candid is a web calendar based on Jquery and Backbone. Eventually it should be able to render Month, Week, and
Mini-Month views. Initially it will just be the week view.

Candid can be built and managed using Grunt. After running grunt the public folder contains all required dependencies,
the demo can be viewed by opening the index.html file in a browser.

Currently this is very early stage and only manages basic creation and editing of CalendarEvents. Drag and drop for
events is nearly done and expanding contracting duration based on drag is next.
